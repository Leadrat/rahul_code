# Quick Start Guide - Flutter Frontend

This guide will help you quickly set up and run the Flutter mobile app for the Tic Tac Toe game.

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Flutter SDK installed (version 3.0.0+)
- [ ] Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension
- [ ] Android Emulator or iOS Simulator set up
- [ ] .NET Core backend running on http://localhost:5281

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Verify Flutter Installation

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
flutter doctor
```

You should see checkmarks for:
- Flutter SDK
- Connected devices (or emulator)
- Android toolchain (if using Android)

### 2. Navigate to Flutter Project

```powershell
cd c:\Users\dhrub\Documents\leadrat\bootcamp\rahul_code\flutter_frontend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```powershell
flutter pub get
```

Wait for all packages to download. This may take a few minutes on first run.

### 4. Start the Backend

Open a new PowerShell window and start the .NET backend:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\dhrub\Documents\leadrat\bootcamp\rahul_code\dotnet_core_backend\GameBackend.API
dotnet run
```

Verify the backend is running at: http://localhost:5281

### 5. Start an Emulator

#### Option A: Android Emulator
```powershell
# List available emulators
flutter emulators

# Launch an emulator (replace <emulator_id> with actual ID from list)
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
```

Or start it from Android Studio: Tools â†’ AVD Manager â†’ Play button

#### Option B: iOS Simulator (macOS only)
```powershell
open -a Simulator
```

### 6. Run the Flutter App

```powershell
# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Or specify a device
flutter devices  # List available devices
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

The app will build and launch automatically!

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "flutter: command not found"
**Solution:** Flutter SDK not in PATH. Add Flutter to your system PATH:
1. Find Flutter installation directory
2. Add `<flutter_dir>\bin` to system PATH
3. Restart PowerShell

### Issue: "No devices found"
**Solution:** No emulator running
- Start Android emulator from Android Studio
- Or use `flutter emulators --launch <id>`
- Run `flutter devices` to verify

### Issue: "Failed to connect to backend"
**Solution:** Backend not running
- Ensure backend is running on http://localhost:5281
- Check firewall isn't blocking the port
- Run `dotnet run` in backend directory

### Issue: Package errors after `flutter pub get`
**Solution:** 
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Issue: App crashes on startup
**Solution:** Check backend is running and accessible
- Verify http://localhost:5281/api works in browser
- Check backend console for errors

## Running on Physical Device

### Android Physical Device:
1. Enable Developer Options on your phone
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Connect phone via USB
4. Allow USB debugging when prompted
5. Update API URLs to use your computer's IP:

**In `lib/services/api_service.dart`:**
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP:5281/api';
```

**In `lib/services/signalr_service.dart`:**
```dart
static final String hubUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP:5281/gameHub';
```

Find your IP: Run `ipconfig` and look for IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

6. Run: `flutter run`

## Development Commands

```powershell
# Hot reload (during development, press 'r' in terminal)
# Hot restart (press 'R')
# Quit app (press 'q')

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Run with specific device
flutter run -d chrome          # Web browser
flutter run -d android         # Android device
flutter run -d emulator-5554   # Specific Android emulator

# Check for issues
flutter doctor -v

# Clean build files
flutter clean
```

## Performance Tips

- **First build is slow** - Subsequent builds are much faster
- **Hot reload** - Use `r` key for instant changes during development
- **Release mode** - Run with `--release` flag for better performance
