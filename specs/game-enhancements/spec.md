# Feature specification: Game enhancements (backend, DB, tests, logging)

**Feature Branch**: `001-game-enhancements`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

This feature adds a backend server and durable storage for the tic-tac-toe
project, plus required test scaffolding and structured logging.

The features below are derived from `README.md` (Must Have / Should Have / Could Have)
and reorganized into independently testable user stories.

## User stories (prioritized)

### US1 - Core Game Persistence & API (Priority: P1)
As a player I can save and load games to/from the server so that game history
is durable across sessions.

Acceptance:
- POST /api/games creates a new game record with moves, timestamps and commentary.
- GET /api/games returns a list of saved games with IDs and timestamps.
- GET /api/games/:id returns details for a single saved game.

Independent Test:
- Contract tests for the above endpoints (request/response shapes).

### US2 - Move History Display & Statistics (Priority: P2)
As a player I can view move history and aggregated game statistics (wins,
losses) stored on the server.

Acceptance:
- Server exposes endpoints for summary statistics and per-game move history.

Independent Test:
- Integration tests that create games and validate statistics endpoints.

### US3 - Commentary & Enhanced Analysis (Priority: P3)
As a player I can get enhanced commentary stored per move so the frontend can
present analysis and replay games.

Acceptance:
- Move entries support commentary text and optional analysis metadata.

Independent Test:
- Unit tests for model serialization and API tests for commentary persistence.

### US4 - Optional: Multiplayer / Replay / Sharing (Priority: P4 - Could)
This covers tournament mode, replay and shareable games; out of scope for MVP
but included in the plan for later phases.

## Requirements (mandatory)

- FR-DB-001: The system MUST persist game records with moves and timestamps.
- FR-API-001: The system MUST expose REST endpoints to create and fetch games.
- FR-LOG-001: The backend MUST emit structured logs for requests, errors, and
  critical state transitions.
- FR-TEST-001: All API endpoints MUST have contract tests; core logic MUST
  have unit tests.

## Success criteria

- SC-001: Persisted games can be created and retrieved within the test suite.
- SC-002: CI runs contract tests and unit tests; PRs that touch backend code
  must include tests.

## Notes

- Data model choice: MongoDB (cloud cluster) for flexible move storage and
  rapid iteration. Migrations policy: use migrations script if schema changes.
