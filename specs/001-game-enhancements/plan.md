# Implementation Plan: Game enhancements (backend, DB, tests, logging)

**Branch**: `001-game-enhancements` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: `C:\Users\dhrub\Documents\leadrat\bootcamp\rahul_code\specs\001-game-enhancements\spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-game-enhancements/spec.md`

## Summary

Deliver a small backend service that provides REST APIs for persisting and
retrieving tic-tac-toe games, supports move commentary, exposes statistics
endpoints, and integrates with the existing Next.js frontend. The backend
will use MongoDB for flexible document storage, include contract and unit
tests, and emit structured logs for observability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js 18.x (LTS) running on Linux (Docker) — local dev
may use Node on Windows.  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express, Mongoose, pino (logging), dotenv, cors,
  jest + supertest for tests.  
**Storage**: MongoDB Atlas cluster (production); local developer flow: SQLite
  is not used for backend — local dev can use a local MongoDB or a Dockerized
  Postgres is not applicable.  
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for API/contract tests.  
**Target Platform**: Web application (frontend Next.js + backend Node.js).  
**Project Type**: Web application (separate `frontend/` and `backend/` folders).  
**Performance Goals**: Initial run-target: p95 API latency < 200ms under
  light load; scale goals TBD in Phase 2 (NEEDS CLARIFICATION).  
**Constraints**: No hard SLO yet; secrets must not be committed; production
  DB is MongoDB Atlas.  
**Scale/Scope**: MVP: thousands of users/month; initial load small (NEEDS
  CLARIFICATION for exact scale). 

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Gates evaluated from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- Tests: Spec includes explicit test requirements (contract tests, unit tests).
- Migrations: Feature involves persistent data; plan includes a migrations
  strategy using `migrate-mongo` or similar and a `migrations/` folder.
- Observability: Backend will use structured logging (pino) and emit request
  metrics; plan documents where logs and metrics will be sent (local dev via
  stdout; production via chosen platform/collector).  
- API Contracts: This plan generates an OpenAPI contract in `/contracts` and
  points to contract tests in `tests/contract/`.

All gates are satisfied at the planning level; Phase 0 will produce research
notes and finalize technology gaps.

```

**Structure Decision**: Use a two-project layout with `backend/` for API and
the existing `frontend/` (Next.js) for UI. This keeps responsibilities
separated and aligns with the API-first principle.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution gate violations detected that require special justification.
Migrations and tests are planned and integrated into the Phase 0/1 deliverables.
