## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

# rahul_code — Tic-Tac-Toe Enhancements Constitution

This constitution defines non-negotiable principles and governance for
enhancing the existing tic-tac-toe project to add a backend server, durable
storage, automated testing, and structured observability.

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First & Quality Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All new features and changes MUST include automated tests before implementation
(unit, integration, contract, or end-to-end as appropriate). Feature branches
MUST fail the relevant tests before any implementation begins (red/green
workflow). All pull requests that modify functionality MUST include tests that
cover the new behavior and any regression risk. Continuous Integration (CI)
MUST run the test suites and block merging on failures for protected branches.

Rationale: Tests are the primary safety net enabling confident refactors,
releases, and cross-cutting improvements (database, logging, backend).

### II. API-First Backend & Contracts
All backend surfaces (HTTP APIs, RPCs, DB contracts) MUST be designed and
documented as explicit contracts. API contracts (OpenAPI/contract files) MUST
be part of the spec and kept in-repo. Contract tests that assert request/response
shape and major behaviour MUST be included in the test suite.

Breaking API changes MUST be accompanied by a migration plan and a MAJOR
version bump following semantic versioning for public contracts.

Rationale: An API-first approach enables independent frontend/back-end work,
clear testing boundaries, and safe evolution of the system.

### III. Durable Data & Migrations
All persistent data MUST be stored in a managed, versioned data model with
schema migrations. Changes to data schemas MUST include migration scripts and
data-backfill plans when required. Local development may use lightweight
databases (SQLite) but production targets SHOULD use networked relational
databases (PostgreSQL) or another explicitly documented backend.

Rationale: Durable storage and repeatable migrations prevent data loss and
enable safe upgrades; they're required for historical move tracking, stats,
and multi-session game features.

### IV. Observability & Structured Logging
Services and the backend MUST emit structured logs (JSON) with at minimum:
timestamp, level, service, correlation/request id, user/session id (if
applicable), and a clear error/message field. Errors and state transitions
MUST be recorded with sufficient context to reproduce and debug failures.
Metrics (request counts, latencies, error rates) SHOULD be produced and
exported to the monitoring tools used by the team.

Rationale: Structured logging and metrics are essential for diagnosing
production incidents, understanding behaviour over time, and validating fixes.

### V. Simplicity, Security & Versioning
Prefer simple, well-understood solutions. Security-by-default MUST be applied
for any network-facing component (input validation, sane CORS, secrets
management). Adopt semantic versioning for the constitution and for public
APIs. Non-functional changes that do not affect public contracts or data MAY
use PATCH or minor version bumps per semantic rules.

Rationale: Simplicity reduces maintenance cost; security and versioning protect
users and integrators from accidental breakage.

## Additional Constraints

- Technology defaults (inferred and recommended):
	- Frontend: Next.js (existing project)
	- Backend: Node.js with a lightweight HTTP framework (Fastify or Express)
	- ORM / migrations: Prisma or a comparable migrations-first tool
	- Database (production): PostgreSQL; Local/dev: SQLite or Dockerized Postgres
	- Testing: Jest for unit, Playwright / Playwright Test or Cypress for E2E
	- Logging: pino or Winston for structured logs

- These defaults are recommendations. Any deviation MUST be documented in the
	implementation plan with rationale and migration path.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

- PRs that implement features described in a spec MUST link to a spec file and
	include the tests for the feature (see Core Principle I). CI pipelines MUST
	execute unit, integration, and contract tests appropriate to the change.
- Foundational work (database schema, migrations, logging infra, CI setup)
	MUST be completed and validated before implementing user stories that depend
	on them. See the tasks template for the foundational checklist.
- Security and privacy checks SHOULD be part of PR review where sensitive data
	or external services are introduced.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution MUST be proposed via a pull request that:

1. Explains the change and its urgency.
2. Provides a migration and compliance plan for existing code and data.
3. Includes a suggested semantic version bump and rationale.
4. Is approved by at least two project maintainers.

Versioning policy:

- MAJOR: Backward-incompatible principle changes or removal of a non-
	negotiable requirement (e.g., remove Test-First or Migrations requirement).
- MINOR: New principle or materially expanded guidance (e.g., add a new
	observability requirement beyond logging).
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes, typos, and non-semantic refinements.

Compliance reviews:

- The project SHOULD run a quarterly constitution compliance review to ensure
	critical gates (tests, migrations, logging, API contracts) remain enforced.
