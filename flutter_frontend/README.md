## Prerequisites

Before running the Flutter app, ensure you have:

1. **Flutter SDK** installed (3.0.0 or higher)
   - Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   - Verify installation: `flutter doctor`

2. **.NET Core Backend** running
   - The backend must be running on `http://localhost:5281`
   - See `../dotnet_core_backend/README.md` for backend setup

3. **Android/iOS Emulator or Physical Device**
   - Android Studio with an emulator configured, or
   - Xcode with iOS Simulator (macOS only), or
   - A physical device connected via USB

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the `flutter_frontend` directory and run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
```

This will download all required packages including:
- `provider` - State management
- `http` - API calls
- `signalr_netcore` - Real-time SignalR connection
- `shared_preferences` - Local storage
- `jwt_decode` - JWT token parsing

### Step 2: Start the Backend

Before running the Flutter app, ensure the .NET Core backend is running:

```powershell
cd ..\dotnet_core_backend\GameBackend.API
dotnet run
```

The backend should be accessible at `http://localhost:5281`

### Step 3: Run the Flutter App

#### For Android Emulator:
1. Start your Android emulator from Android Studio
2. Run the app:
```powershell
flutter run
```

#### For iOS Simulator (macOS only):
1. Start iOS Simulator
2. Run the app:
```powershell
flutter run
```

#### For Physical Device:
1. Enable USB debugging on your device
2. Connect via USB
3. Run:
```powershell
flutter devices  # Verify device is detected
flutter run
```

#### For Chrome (Web - for testing only):
```powershell
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Note:** For Android emulators, the localhost backend URL (`http://localhost:5281`) will automatically work. For physical devices, you'll need to update the API URLs in the code to use your computer's IP address.

### Step 4: Update API URL for Physical Devices (if needed)

If testing on a physical device, update the backend URL:

**File:** `lib/services/api_service.dart`
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5281/api';
```

**File:** `lib/services/signalr_service.dart`
```dart
static final String hubUrl = 'http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5281/gameHub';
```

Replace `YOUR_COMPUTER_IP` with your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

## Architecture

### State Management
The app uses the **Provider** pattern for state management:
- `AuthProvider` - Manages authentication state and user info
- `GameProvider` - Manages game state, moves, and multiplayer sessions

### API Communication
- **HTTP** - RESTful API calls for CRUD operations
- **SignalR** - Real-time bidirectional communication for:
  - Game invitations
  - Online presence
  - Move synchronization
  - Game start events

### Data Flow
1. User actions trigger provider methods
2. Providers call API services
3. API responses update provider state
4. UI rebuilds automatically via `Consumer` widgets
5. SignalR events update state in real-time

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues
**Problem:** "Failed to connect to SignalR"
**Solution:**
- Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:5281`
- Check that no firewall is blocking the connection
- For physical devices, update URLs to use your computer's IP

### Token Errors
**Problem:** "Unauthorized" errors
**Solution:**
- The JWT token may have expired
- Logout and login again
- Check that the backend is using compatible JWT settings

### SignalR Not Working
**Problem:** Real-time features not syncing
**Solution:**
- Check backend console for SignalR connection logs
- Verify both users are logged in and connected
- Check network connectivity
- Restart the app to reconnect SignalR

### Build Errors
**Problem:** "Target of URI doesn't exist" errors
**Solution:**
- Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
- Run `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get`
- Restart your IDE

### Android Emulator Issues
**Problem:** App won't install or run
**Solution:**
- Update Android SDK via Android Studio
- Create a new emulator with API level 30+
- Enable "Wipe Data" on emulator and restart

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Test Multiplayer Functionality
1. Run the app on two different devices/emulators
2. Register two different users
3. Login with both users
4. From one device, invite the other user's email
5. Accept the invite on the second device
6. Play the game and watch moves sync in real-time

### Test Admin Panel
1. Create an admin user in the database manually or via backend
2. Login with the admin account
3. Access Admin Panel from the profile menu
4. View players and games

## Performance Tips

- SignalR connection is established once on app start
- Game state is managed efficiently with Provider
- Only necessary widgets rebuild on state changes
- Images and assets are optimized for mobile

## Known Limitations

- No offline mode (requires backend connection)
- SignalR reconnection may take a few seconds
- Admin status must be set via database
- No game replay feature (planned for future)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Game replay with animations
- [ ] Push notifications for invites
- [ ] Chat during games
- [ ] Leaderboard and rankings
- [ ] AI difficulty levels
- [ ] Custom themes
- [ ] Game statistics and charts

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the backend logs for API errors
2. Check Flutter debug console for client errors
3. Verify SignalR connection status in logs
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed
