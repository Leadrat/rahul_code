## API Endpoints Used

Both frontends use identical API endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/me`

### Games
- `GET /api/games`
- `GET /api/games/{id}`
- `POST /api/games`
- `DELETE /api/games/{id}`

### Invites
- `GET /api/invites`
- `POST /api/invites`
- `POST /api/invites/{id}/respond`
- `DELETE /api/invites/{id}`

- `invite:received`
- `presence:changed`
- `online:users`
- `game:started`
- `game:please-start`
- `move:applied`

## Implementation Differences

While both frontends have feature parity, there are some implementation differences:

### State Management
- **Next.js**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **Flutter**: Provider pattern (ChangeNotifier)

### Routing
- **Next.js**: File-based routing with Next.js
- **Flutter**: Programmatic navigation with Navigator

### Storage
- **Next.js**: localStorage for web
- **Flutter**: SharedPreferences for mobile

### Real-time
- **Next.js**: @microsoft/signalr (JavaScript)
- **Flutter**: signalr_netcore (Dart)

### HTTP Requests
- **Next.js**: fetch API
- **Flutter**: http package

### Styling
- **Next.js**: CSS Modules + inline styles
- **Flutter**: Widget-based styling with Material Design

## Mobile-Specific Advantages

The Flutter app has some advantages over the web version:

1. **Native Performance** - Compiled to native ARM code
2. **Offline Capability** - Can implement offline mode easily
3. **Push Notifications** - Can add FCM notifications for invites
4. **Platform Integration** - Access to camera, contacts, etc.
5. **App Store Distribution** - Can publish to Google Play/App Store
6. **Better Touch Gestures** - Optimized for mobile interactions
7. **Persistent Connection** - Better background connection handling

## Testing Scenarios

Both implementations support the same testing scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Single Player
1. Login → New Local Game → Play → Win/Draw

### Scenario 2: Multiplayer
1. User A: Login → Invite User B
2. User B: Login → Accept Invite
3. Both: Play game with real-time sync
4. Both: See winner/draw result

### Scenario 3: Admin Features
1. Admin: Login → Open Admin Panel
2. Admin: View players and statistics
3. Admin: Click player → View their games
4. Admin: Delete a game

### Scenario 4: Real-time Features

3. User A: Send invite (User B gets notification)
4. User B: Accept (both start game)
5. Both: Moves sync instantly

## Performance Comparison
