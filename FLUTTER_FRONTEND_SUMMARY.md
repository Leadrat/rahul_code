   ```powershell
   cd dotnet_core_backend\GameBackend.API
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Install Flutter Dependencies**
   ```powershell
   cd flutter_frontend
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Start an Emulator**
   ```powershell
   flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
   ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```powershell
   flutter run
   ```

### Detailed Instructions

## 🔧 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Framework | Flutter 3.0+ |
| Language | Dart |
| State Management | Provider |
| HTTP Client | http package |
| Real-time | signalr_netcore |
| Storage | shared_preferences |
| JWT Handling | jwt_decode |

## 📊 API Integration

The Flutter app connects to the same .NET Core backend as the Next.js frontend:

**Backend URL:** `http://localhost:5281`

### Endpoints Used
- Authentication: `/api/auth/*`
- Games: `/api/games/*`
- Invites: `/api/invites/*`
- Admin: `/api/admin/*`
- SignalR Hub: `/gameHub`

## 🎮 Usage Flow

### First-Time User
1. Launch app → See login screen
2. Tap "Create account"
3. Register with email/password
4. Return and login
5. Play local game or invite friends

### Multiplayer Game
1. User A: Tap "Invite Player" → Enter User B's email
2. User B: Receives notification → Tap 🔔 → Accept
3. Both users: Game starts automatically
4. Take turns → Moves sync in real-time
5. Game ends → Winner announced

### Admin User
1. Login with admin account
2. Tap profile icon → "Admin Panel"
3. View players and statistics
4. Click player → View their games
5. Delete games if needed

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before deployment, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Registration works
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Local game playable
- [ ] Can send invites
- [ ] Can receive invites
- [ ] Multiplayer game syncs moves
- [ ] Win detection works
- [ ] Draw detection works
- [ ] Admin panel accessible (if admin)
- [ ] Logout works
- [ ] Auto-login works after restart

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### State Management
- **Provider pattern** for clean separation of concerns
- `AuthProvider` manages authentication state
- `GameProvider` manages game state and logic
- UI automatically rebuilds on state changes

### Real-time Communication
- SignalR connection established on login
- Automatic reconnection on network issues
- Events handled in GameProvider
- Moves sync instantly between devices

### Security
- JWT tokens stored securely in SharedPreferences
- Tokens sent in Authorization headers
- Admin routes protected server-side
- Input validation on both client and server

### Performance
- Optimized widget rebuilding with Consumer
- Efficient state updates
- Minimal API calls
- SignalR for instant updates

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Backend Required**: The Flutter app requires the .NET Core backend to be running. It cannot function standalone.

2. **Network Configuration**: 
   - Emulators: Use `localhost`
   - Physical devices: Update API URLs to your computer's IP address

3. **First Build**: The initial build may take 2-5 minutes. Subsequent builds are much faster.

4. **Hot Reload**: During development, press 'r' for instant code updates without restarting.

## 🎉 What's Different from Next.js?

While functionality is identical, Flutter offers:

- **Native Performance** - Compiled to ARM code
- **Better Mobile UX** - Optimized touch interactions
- **Offline Potential** - Can implement offline mode
- **Push Notifications** - Can add FCM notifications
- **App Store Ready** - Can publish to Google Play/App Store
- **Cross-platform** - Same code for Android and iOS

## 📦 Building for Production

### Android APK
```powershell
cd flutter_frontend
flutter build apk --release
```
Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### iOS App (macOS only)
```powershell
flutter build ios --release
```

### App Bundle (for Google Play)
```powershell
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## 🤝 Backend Integration

The Flutter app integrates seamlessly with the existing backend:

| Feature | Backend API | Flutter Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Login | POST /api/auth/login | ApiService.login() |
| Register | POST /api/auth/register | ApiService.register() |
| Get Games | GET /api/games | ApiService.getUserGames() |
| Send Invite | POST /api/invites | ApiService.createInvite() |
| Accept Invite | POST /api/invites/{id}/respond | ApiService.respondToInvite() |
| Real-time | SignalR /gameHub | SignalRService.connect() |

## 📈 Next Steps

The app is production-ready, but you can enhance it with:

1. **Push Notifications** - Firebase Cloud Messaging for invites
2. **Offline Mode** - Store games locally with SQLite
3. **Game Replay** - Animate saved games
4. **Chat System** - Add in-game chat
5. **Leaderboards** - Rankings and statistics
6. **Themes** - Light mode, custom colors
7. **Sound Effects** - Audio feedback for moves

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**"Flutter not found"**
→ Install Flutter SDK and add to PATH

**"No devices found"**
→ Start an emulator or connect a device

**"Failed to connect to backend"**
→ Ensure backend is running on localhost:5281

**"SignalR connection failed"**
→ Check backend logs, verify JWT token is valid

**Package errors**
→ Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

For detailed troubleshooting, see `flutter_frontend/README.md`
